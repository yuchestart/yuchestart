🌎 I live on Earth, on a landmass called North America, in an artificially defined region called the United States.<br>
🕑 I basically have no time to code :(<br>
🏷️ I don't know why I chose my username<br>
🐈 I like cats<br>
🔭 I am currently working on [CATS](https://github.com/What-ever-this-is/CATS), [Splatshooter(while collaborating with others)](https://github.com/What-ever-this-is/Splatshooter), and I plan to make a physics engine kind of thing.<br>
